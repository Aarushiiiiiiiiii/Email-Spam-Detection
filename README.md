## Introduction

Email spam is a prevalent issue that can lead to wasted time, security risks, and loss of productivity. This project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting and filtering out spam emails using a machine learning approach.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- Model training with various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-detection.git
cd email-spam-detection
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the email data.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, etc.
3. **Model Training:** Train the model using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or Random Forest.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Example

You can find the complete implementation in the Colab notebook. Open the notebook in Google Colab and run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

```python
from spam_detector import SpamDetector

# Initialize the model
detector = SpamDetector()

# Train the model
detector.train('path/to/dataset.csv')

# Predict spam or not spam
email_content = "Congratulations! You've won a free ticket to the Bahamas!"
result = detector.predict(email_content)
print(f'The email is: {result}')
```

## Data

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle. Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and includes labeled email samples.

## Model

The model is built using Scikit-Learn and employs various machine learning algorithms. The pipeline includes:

- Data cleaning
- EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Output as Desired
